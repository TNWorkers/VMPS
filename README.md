# Variational Matrix Product State library

This is a library for dealing with many-body Hamiltonians using algorithms based on variational matrix-product states (VMPS or MPS).

## Features

- ground states for one-dimensional chains and general molecular geometries
- infinite systems using the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism
- U(1), SU(2) [spin and charge] and Z(N) symmetries

## Dependencies

- C++, Eigen, boost

## Contributing

A project by Roman Rausch, Matthias Peschke, Cassian Plorin
