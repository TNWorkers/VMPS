 * # Introduction
 *
 * The VMPS library (*variational matrix product states*) is a c++ library for different algorithms, 
 * all based on the structure of matrix product states (MPS) and matrix product operators (MPO).
 * All the datastructures (MPS or MPO) can respect abelian and non abelian symmetries for more efficiency of the algorithms. 
 *
 * # Solvers
 * Different solvers are collected here: \ref Solvers
 *
 * # Supported models
 * All models are collected here: \ref Models
 *
 * # Symmetries
 * The different possible symmetries can be found here: \ref Symmetry
